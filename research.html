<h1 style="color:white;">Research</h1>
<p style="color:white">Currently, I am interested in a method introduced by Adrian Price-Whelan (Orbital Torus Imaging), which he developed to constrain the Milky Way’s disk mass, scale height, and disk-halo mass ratio. I am working on applying this technique to our simulations to further validate this approach. Additionally, I am working on investigating the utility of a tool from biology (phylogenetic trees, first introduced to astronomy by Paula Jofré) to recover the formation history of a simulated galaxy using present day chemo-dynamic information.
