<h1 style="color:white;">About Me</h1>
<p style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0,  0.3);color:white">I am a friendly graduate student in the Department of Physics at UC Merced working with Dr. Sarah Loebman on using simulations to research the evolution of stars in the galactic disk.  <br><br><br><br>Research Interests: Particularly, I am interested in the average speed of stars that are located within the same vicinity, that have the same radius or distance from the galactic center. Using high-resolution simulations, I am drawing comparisons of stellar behavior to SDSS observations. Ultimately, I want to understand the mechanism that causes groups of stars to co-orbit. <br><br><br><br>Hobbies: Hiking, traveling, & getting to know new people! :) <br><br><br><br>
